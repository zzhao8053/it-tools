### Create a new tool

To create a new tool, there is a script that generate the boilerplate of the new tool, simply run:

```sh
pnpm run script:create:tool my-tool-name
```

It will create a directory in `src/tools` with the correct files, and a the import in `src/tools/index.ts`. You will just need to add the imported tool in the proper category and develop the tool.
